**Educational experience**
<p>
I was a GSI at Berkeley for nearly all of the courses in the department.
<br>
So I have seen a lot of different teaching styles and approaches. 
<br>Largely inefficient: overlapping material between classes; tons of slides; no central location.
<br>
Island at Idaho Falls for resources
<br>
Example from Steve

<br>
**Online educational experience**
<br>
<p>
I moved exclusively online when I started at Diablo Valley College.
<br>
Lectures on <a href='https://prezi.com/user/thedoctorrab/'>prezi</a>

<br>
At Idaho, I went to a workshop about OER and developed them for <a href='https://courses.candelalearning.com/x84x9/'>both</a> <a href='https://courses.candelalearning.com/riskassessment/'>classes</a>.
<br>
I teach Fundamentals of Nuclear Engineering (Lamarsh) with MCNP and Risk Assessment. 
<br>
One section of NE is on the Idaho Falls campus, another in Rexburg taught by a TA.
<br>
Concept of nodes

<br>
**Outcomes for workshop**
<br>
<p>
I am not as experienced in GitFlow as everyone else, and I would like to develop that skill for class/research.
<br>
Some of the materials developed here should be applicable to my NE course too. 
<br>
Some material I have might be useful too. 
<br>
This can also be used for Risk Assessment, where there is a lot of common material, and for MCNP modules.
